The Idea Behind Support Vector Regression

The problem of regression is to find a function that approximates 
mapping from an input domain to real numbers on the basis of a training sample. 
So letâ€™s now dive deep and understand how SVR works actually.

Step 3: Feature Scaling

A real-world dataset contains features that vary in magnitudes, units, and range. I would suggest performing normalization when the scale of a feature is irrelevant or misleading.

Feature Scaling basically helps to normalize the data within a particular range. Normally several common class types contain the feature scaling function so that they make feature scaling automatically. However, the SVR class is not a commonly used class type so we should perform feature scaling using Python.
